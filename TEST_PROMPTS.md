## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Run the Comprehensive Test Script
```bash
cd /Users/user/Desktop/Akshay/llm-code-context-optimizer
python test_rag_system.py
```

### Option 2: Test Individual Queries
```python
from rag.core.rag_system import RAGSystem

# Setup RAG system
rag_system = RAGSystem()

# Index the sample project
rag_system.index_codebase(
    project_path="sample_project",
    file_patterns=["*.py"],
    force_reindex=True
)

# Test a query
response = rag_system.query(
    query="How does user authentication work?",
    max_context_tokens=4000,
    top_k=8
)

print(f"Tokens used: {response.total_tokens}")
print(f"Chunks retrieved: {response.chunks_count}")
print(f"Context:\n{response.context}")
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Chunking Benefits
1. **Complete Classes**: UserManager, DatabaseManager should appear as single chunks
2. **Smart Imports**: Only relevant imports included in each chunk
3. **Better Context**: Related methods kept together
4. **Fewer Chunks**: More efficient storage with better context

### ‚úÖ Improved Retrieval
1. **Relevant Results**: Queries should find the right files and classes
2. **Context Quality**: Retrieved context should be complete and useful
3. **Cross-File Understanding**: Queries spanning multiple files should work
4. **Performance**: Fast retrieval with good token efficiency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Monitor
1. **Token Usage**: Should be efficient compared to old system
2. **Chunk Quality**: Complete classes vs fragmented methods
3. **Retrieval Accuracy**: Finding the right code for each query
4. **Error Handling**: No more Qdrant filtering errors

## Expected Results

With the enhanced system, you should see:
- **30-50% fewer chunks** due to class consolidation
- **Better context quality** with complete class definitions
- **Improved retrieval accuracy** for class-related queries
- **No Qdrant errors** during retrieval
- **Faster query responses** due to better chunking

Try these prompts and let me know how the enhanced RAG system performs!
